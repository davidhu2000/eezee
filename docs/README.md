# Eezee

## Background

Over the past few years several digital streaming services have gained considerable traction. Due to licensing restrictions the full library of multimedia is now fragmented across these platforms, which puts a burden on the user to find the location of the content they seek. The resulting nuisance has created a gap in the market that we intend to fill. Our initial goal is to provide a digital service that queries all relevant streaming services and informs the user where to find the content they seek. For instance, if a Netflix user wants to watch "The Shawshank Redemption" they will log into their account only to find that the film isn't available. Instead of wasting their time looking through other streaming application one at a time, the user can visit Eezee and immediately see which platforms contain their desired content. Future Implementation will include logic to recommend films to the users based on their previous searches and current search.
